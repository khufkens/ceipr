\description{
Load data for specified pollutant(s), for specified sector(s) and all years from
a directory of zip files, or an online path. For the latter option your,
milage might vary and it is recommended to download files of interest first
using the ceip_download() function as it is less likely to cause time-out
issues and will limit overall traffic to the server.
